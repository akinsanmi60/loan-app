      "The date of the first repayment of your loan will be shown on your provisional offer details and on the loan agreement under the introductory section. You will also be able to view it under the loan repayment schedule on your Lendwise dashboard. In general, borrowers in full-time education will benefit from a grace period for the whole duration of the studies (and potentially a short period following completion of studies of up to 6 months). Repayments for borrowers in part-time education will, most of the times, commence the month after the signing of the loan agreement.",

    description:
      "If your circumstances have changed, for example, you have changed jobs, and you wish to change the date your monthly direct debit repayments are collected, you can email  with your request. We require at least 2 weeks’ notice before any amendments can be made, and will do our best to accommodate your requirements. Please note, changing the date on which your monthly repayment is collected, may effect the overall amount of interest accrued.  In most cases your monthly repayment amount will stay the same and any adjustment will be reflected in the final monthly repayment of your loan. We will of course notify you of any changes once your date change is confirmed.",
